Project Description

This project is focused on the development of a personal portfolio website, created using HTML and CSS, designed to showcase my skills, projects, and accomplishments as a Computer Science student. The primary goal of this portfolio is to create an accessible and visually appealing platform where potential employers, collaborators, and peers can learn more about me and my work.

The website is structured into several key sections:

1. Home Section: The home section serves as the welcoming page of the portfolio. It includes a profile image, which is centrally positioned with a hover effect that enlarges the image, enhancing the interactivity of the page. The profile image is styled to appear circular, with smooth transitions when hovered over. The section also includes a brief introduction that highlights my background, skills, and areas of expertise. The text is aligned neatly beside the image for a clean and professional look.

2. About Section: The About section provides a more in-depth look at my educational background, projects, and career aspirations. This section is designed to be both informative and easy to read, allowing visitors to quickly understand my journey and what I have achieved so far. The content is presented in a well-organized manner, with bullet points and brief paragraphs to keep the information digestible.

3. Projects Section: This section highlights key projects that I have worked on during my studies. Each project is presented with a brief description, a link to the project repository (if available), and any relevant technologies or tools used. The goal is to showcase the practical application of my skills and the work I’ve done in various domains like software development, data science, machine learning, and web development.

4. Skills Section: The skills section outlines the technical tools and programming languages I am proficient in. This section uses a clean layout with icons and brief descriptions, making it easy for visitors to quickly scan and assess my skill set.

5. Contact Section: The contact section includes a contact form, where visitors can send me messages directly. The form collects basic details such as the user’s name, email, and a message. This feature is designed to make it easy for potential collaborators, employers, or anyone interested in reaching out to me.

 Features and Customization

The website features a responsive design, ensuring that it looks good on all screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices. It uses CSS transitions for smooth hover effects, such as enlarging the profile image and changing button colors. The layout is simple and intuitive, with a clean color palette to maintain focus on the content.

- Hover Effects: The profile image grows in size when hovered over, creating an interactive experience for the user.
- Responsive Design: The layout is designed to be fluid, adapting seamlessly to different screen sizes.
- Modern Styling: I have utilized modern CSS techniques, such as `flexbox` and `grid`, to ensure that the content is well-aligned and properly spaced.

Tools and Technologies

- HTML5: Used to structure the content of the webpage. The use of semantic HTML elements like `<section>`, `<header>`, and `<footer>` ensures that the page is well-organized and accessible.
- CSS3: The styling is done using CSS3, making use of advanced techniques like flexbox for layout management, transitions for smooth animations, and custom styles for buttons and forms.
- Responsive Design: The site is fully responsive, meaning it adjusts gracefully to different screen sizes using media queries.

### Conclusion

This project serves as a personal showcase of my web development skills. It is continuously evolving as I acquire new skills and complete more projects. In the future, I plan to add more sections, such as a blog or a section dedicated to my contributions in open-source projects. This portfolio is an essential tool in presenting myself professionally and effectively, and I am excited to share it with the world.
